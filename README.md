# Benchmark Problems for Dynamic Modeling of Intracellular Processes
A collection of ODE models with experimental data as benchmark problems in order to evaluate new and existing methodologies for data-based modelling

The benchmark models were export from Data2Dynamics (https://github.com/Data2Dynamics/d2d), version of Aug 17th 2018, commit tag f27f9fd554fd23f9c048239172fafc6686a27fe0.
Export can be repeated by compiling the respective model within the 'Example' folder, followed by call of 'arExportBenchmark'
