# Benchmark Problems for Dynamic Modeling of Intracellular Processes
A collection of ODE models with experimental data as benchmark problems in order to evaluate new and existing methodologies for data-based modeling. A preprint for the introduction and analysis of the benchmark problem collection is available at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/30/404590.

The benchmark models were export from Data2Dynamics (https://github.com/Data2Dynamics/d2d), version of Aug 17th 2018, commit tag f27f9fd554fd23f9c048239172fafc6686a27fe0.
Export can be repeated by compiling the respective model within the 'Example' folder, followed by call of `arExportBenchmark`

We provide descriptions about using the benchmark models in the Wiki (https://github.com/Benchmarking-Initiative/Benchmark-Models/wiki) in this github repository. 

Contributions to the collection are very welcome. For this, please fork the repository, add your model and test your files with the provided functions, and start a pull request. We will then check your model and merge it into the collection. We are continuously working on the extension of the collection.
